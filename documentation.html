			<h1>Documentation</h1>
			
			<p>
				In this documentation I'll give some explanations on the saving mechanics, the settings and
				explain how to put your own tasks in the game.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Saving mechanics</h2>
			
			<p>
				Currently, the game autosave everytime your number of points is modified. This means that almost 
				everything is saved, barring the state of running timed tasks. Saving the state of these tasks 
				may be possible in a future version, but is not currrently possible. Therefore, these tasks will
				be cancelled if you close the window.  Other than that, everything is saved without any 
				interaction of your part.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Please note that if you ever move the game elsewhere on your computer, your save may be lost.
				Also, the game is saved in the so-called Local Storage of your navigator. So don't
				use any software that may clean the localstorage, which will get your game lost.
			</p>
			
			
			<h2>Settings</h2>
			
			<p>
				The settings can be set at the beginning of the game. Some presets have been added in order to 
				make them easier to choose. But please note that these presets may not be the best, considering
				I haven't tested them all. I'm open to your feedback about them. 
				Once the game has begun, the settings can't no longer
				be modified in-game. In order to modify them, you have to go in the file 
				<a href="settings.html">settings.html</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are only currently three settings that can be modified at the beginning of the game (without
				counting the gender): the multiplier, which is by how much the values of the tasks will be multiplied
				everytime you perform them; the goal, which is how much points you have to gather in order to have a
				100% chance to cum; and the orgasm cost, which is how much it will cost you to take your chance to
				hope having an orgasm with your current chance to cum.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you want, you can skip the introduction and set the settings directly in the file <strong>scripts/default_settings.js</strong>.
				In order to do that, complete the lines 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the file by your settings; then, set
				disallow_settings_modification to true (the line 5 will be: <code>var disallow_settings_modification = true;</code>)
			</p>
			
			<h2>Modifying the tasks list</h2>
			
			<p>
				While support for multiple tasks lists is planned, using your own tasks in the game is currently only possible by
				modifying the default task list. In order to do that, open the file <strong>tasks_lists/default.js</strong> with
				any text editor. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In order to add a new task, you have to add a line of the pattern <code>new_task("Text of the task", 5);</code>,
				where the text of the task contains either a number of times, indicated by the letter "x", or a number of
				seconds, indicated by the letter "s". You might also not add any number at all, if the task has always to be 
				done once. The following number (which in the example is 5) is the number of points given for doing the task.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If the task is only for a specific gender, you may add its name afterwards. Example: 
				<code>new_task("Do this task 5x", 10, "male")</code>. You may only add either "male" or "female"; don't
				forget the quotation marks.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you want to add a category, you only have to add <code>new_cat("Name of the category")</code> wherever
				you want. You can also only display this category for a specific gender: <code>new_cat("Feminization", "male")</code>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you need more examples, you can look at the large list of default tasks.
